# doorbell

Project Goals:
Allow for doorbell press to:
- Capture still image and Record 20s video
- Sound a buzzer so doorbell user gets audible feedback of button press
- Send "doorbell/pressed" MQTT message to Home Assistant
- Node red automation listening for MQTT message
- Send push notifications (via Telegram?)

Without button press, allow for object (person only) detection:
- Tensorflow ([Tensorflow HA Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tensorflow/) | [Install Page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)) 
- Tensorflow Lite
- DOODS ([DOODS HA Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/doods/) | [DOODS in GIT](https://github.com/snowzach/doods))
- Other software?

# Capture still image and Record 20s video


<insert python script>

### Getting Set up to Write Images and Video Directly to Home Assistant Directory
Install Samba client AND server on Pi. The server function will probably not be used from the Pi. In this set up, the Pi is acting as the client and the [Samba add-on in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/configuration/#editing-configuration-via-sambawindows-networking) is acting as the server, but better to have both anyway.
Install instructions I used are [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/samba.md)

### To mount a HA directory to Pi directory:
```sudo mount.cifs //HASSIO9/config/www/doorbell /home/pi/projects/doorbell  -o user=kevin```
- Server: //HASSIO9/config/www/doorbell is the host name + folder path
- Client: /home/pi/projects/doorbell is the client side + folder path
- Run the cmd and enter pwd when prompted. This works to mount mannually but **does not survive reboot!**
- To survive reboot, you must add a permenant mount; so far I have been unscessful

### Setting Up a Perm Mount [fstab] method
[This page](http://timlehr.com/auto-mount-samba-cifs-shares-via-fstab-on-linux/) has pretty clear instructions that got it working for me. I still need to figure out how to use credentials, however.

- Navigate to Pi's root: ```cd /```
- Edit fstab: ```sudo nano /etc/fstab```
- Enter below configuration, but DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE!

```
//HASSIO9/config/www/doorbell 	/home/pi/projects/doorbell 	cifs 	uid=0,username=*****,password=**********,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0,noperm 0 0
```
- Reboot ```sudo reboot```

- Take test picture, store in mounted share folder: ```sudo raspistill -o "/home/pi/projects/doorbell/testpicture.jpg"```

- Verify the picture saved in the right place sucessfully:
```
pi@DB3A:~ $ cd /home/pi/projects/doorbell
pi@DB3A:~/projects/doorbell $ ls
testpicture.jpg  me.jpg  test1.jpg  testfordoorbellfolder.txt  testremounted1.jpg
pi@DB3A:~/projects/doorbell $ 
```

### Setting Up a Perm Mount [systemd] method

Using [this guide](https://anteru.net/blog/2019/automatic-mounts-using-systemd/) I did everything between the X's, it worked once, then fails to start. Probably a password/config issue in home-pi-projects-doorbell.mount file, but I can't figure it out. Therefore, to mount after boot, I'll just boot then run ```sudo mount -a``` manually for now.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- In ```/etc/systemd/system``` create a file named ```home-pi-projects-doorbell.mount```
- ```cd /etc/systemd/system```
- ```sudo nano home-pi-projects-doorbell.mount```

```
==========================================
[Unit]
Description=myshare mount

[Mount]
What=//HASSIO9/config/www/doorbell
Where=/home/pi/projects/doorbell
Type=cifs
Options=rw,file_mode=0700,dir_mode=0700,uid=1000,user=********,password=********
DirectoryMode=0700
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
==========================================
```


- Also in ```/etc/systemd/system``` create a file named ```home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount```
- ```sudo nano home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount```
```
==========================================
[Unit]
Description=myshare automount

[Automount]
Where=/home/pi/projects/doorbell

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
==========================================
```

### This [home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount] is the unit we want to enable and start automatically, so we need to perform the following steps:

- ```systemctl daemon-reload```                            					to reload the configuration
- ```systemctl start home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount```   		to start the unit â€“ so we can use it right away
- ```systemctl enable home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount``` 	 	to enable the auto-start of the unit
- ```systemctl status home-pi-projects-doorbell.automount```		  to check status


# HTTP POST to push images

Images will be received within HA by the [Push integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/push/)

Not sure this fits in other chanels - so throwing this out there in #other. I have been unsuccessful at getting a Samba share from a Raspberry Pi (w/ cam) to my HA instance, which runs on a Windows 10 machine via VirtualBox VM. So, I am looking for alternatives to get pictures (taken by the Pi) over into my HA instance so I can use them in Lovelace, send them with notifications, and maybe do some object/person detection with Tensorflow later.

In HA, I have the standard directories - config, share, addons, ssl, and backup. Keeping in mind that I am a Linux neophyte - Is it possible to mount the /share directory to the Pi somehow - so that I can write the images captured by the Pi cam directly to /share?

If this is not possible - how else could this (the movement of Pi based images to HA) be accomplished?

TinkererToday at 4:35 PM
Samba should absolutely work, and #add-ons can help you there
[4:36 PM]
Alternatively, SSH (SFTP/SCP) works too, but is less neophyte friendly

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:37 PM
I have Samba working  (as an add on in HA) and that allows me to access via my Windows laptop - but I can't get samba running on the Pi to allow me to see "pi based files" within the HA folders.

TinkererToday at 4:37 PM
Well, you'd want to mount the shares from HA onto the Pi
[4:38 PM]
SCP/SFTP may be easier - depending on what you're doing

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:38 PM
I also have been able to copy files over via SSH - but I have to enter a password everytime - and eventually this will all be in a py script, if I can figure that part out (Google Fu)

TinkererToday at 4:38 PM
You want keys 
[4:38 PM]
You can create a key without a passphrase, and use that in the script

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:39 PM
its a doorbell - press button, cam snaps, *move picture to HA

TinkererToday at 4:39 PM
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/push/

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:39 PM
cool - so keys...and, as far as how to mount the shares from HA onto the Pi -  can you point me to something I can readd up on?

TinkererToday at 4:40 PM
The push integration is likely your actual answer here

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:41 PM
ok I'll read up on that. I actually started this thinking motioneyeOS would be the best bet - but backed off that (for a reason I can't recall at the moment!)

TinkererToday at 4:41 PM
MotionEye is awesome if you're doing motion detection, but for what you've described maybe not a great solution

clandestine avocadoToday at 4:42 PM
yeah it's pretty sweet. I reseeded my lawn last week and I have a Pi zero doing a timelapse with motioneye right now lol
[4:43 PM]
so for the Push cam, all I need to do it HTTP POST the image with the py script, and I should be good (reading quickly here)

TinkererToday at 4:43 PM
Yup





# MQTT 

**Goal**: Send pictures taken by the Pi cam on the Pi 3A (Doorbell) to Home Assistant server running the [Mosquitto MQTT Broker Add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker/).

### Install and Testing Connection:
- On the Pi 3A device, install [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) via the ```pip install paho-mqtt``` command
- Create [testing_mqtt_con_to_HA.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clandestine-avocado/doorbell/master/mqtt/testing_mqtt_con_to_HA.py?token=ANPVX4PEY5A46BDX22IIAIC7KTDMS) on the Pi 3A
- Subscribe to "DOORBELL" topic on the HA Mosquitto broker.
- Run testing_mqtt_con_to_HA.py and confirm DOORBELL topic is received





```
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt # Import the MQTT library

import time # The time library is useful for delays

 

# Our "on message" event

def messageFunction (client, userdata, message):

topic = str(message.topic)

message = str(message.payload.decode("utf-8"))

print(topic + message)

 

 

ourClient = mqtt.Client("pi3a_mqtt") # Create a MQTT client object

ourClient.connect("192.168.1.237", 1883) # Connect to the HA Mosquitto MQTT broker (or test MQTT broker @ test.mosquitto.org)

ourClient.subscribe("DOORBELL") # Subscribe to the topic DOORBELL

ourClient.on_message = messageFunction # Attach the messageFunction to subscription

ourClient.loop_start() # Start the MQTT client

 

 

# Main program loop

while(1):

ourClient.publish("DOORBELL", "on") # Publish message to MQTT broker

time.sleep(1) # Sleep for a second
```
